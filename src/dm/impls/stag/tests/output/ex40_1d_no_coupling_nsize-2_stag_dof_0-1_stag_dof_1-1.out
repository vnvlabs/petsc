  ---------- Testing Jacobian -------------
  Run with -snes_test_jacobian_view and optionally -snes_test_jacobian <threshold> to show difference
    of hand-coded and finite difference Jacobian entries greater than <threshold>.
  Testing hand-coded Jacobian, if (for double precision runs) ||J - Jfd||_F/||J||_F is
    O(1.e-8), the hand-coded Jacobian is probably correct.
  ||J - Jfd||_F/||J||_F = 1.43879e-08, ||J - Jfd||_F = 7.91201e-06
  ---------- Testing Jacobian -------------
  ||J - Jfd||_F/||J||_F = 2.53446e-08, ||J - Jfd||_F = 6.19432e-06
