  ---------- Testing Jacobian -------------
  Run with -snes_test_jacobian_view and optionally -snes_test_jacobian <threshold> to show difference
    of hand-coded and finite difference Jacobian entries greater than <threshold>.
  Testing hand-coded Jacobian, if (for double precision runs) ||J - Jfd||_F/||J||_F is
    O(1.e-8), the hand-coded Jacobian is probably correct.
  ||J - Jfd||_F/||J||_F = 1.46451e-08, ||J - Jfd||_F = 2.13061e-05
  ---------- Testing Jacobian -------------
  ||J - Jfd||_F/||J||_F = 2.75928e-08, ||J - Jfd||_F = 1.78412e-05
