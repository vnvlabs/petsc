Compare label "label0" with "label1": Stratum values in DMLabel l0 "label0" are different than in DMLabel l1 "label1"
Compare label "label1" with "label3": Default value of DMLabel l0 "label1" = 333 != -1 = Default value of DMLabel l1 "label3"
Compare label "label1" with "label3": Stratum values in DMLabel l0 "label1" are different than in DMLabel l1 "label3"
Compare label "label1" with "label3": Stratum #0 with value 2 contains different points in DMLabel l0 "label1" and DMLabel l1 "label3"
Labels of DMs "plex0" and "plex1" differ: Number of labels in dm0 = 12 != 8 = Number of labels in dm1
Compare label "label2" with "label2": Stratum values in DMLabel l0 "label2" are different than in DMLabel l1 "label2"
Labels of DMs "plex0" and "plex1" differ: Stratum values in DMLabel l0 "label2" are different than in DMLabel l1 "label2"
Labels of DMs "plex0" and "plex1" differ: Label "label2" (#10 in dm0) not found in dm1
